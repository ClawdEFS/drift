# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*This is not a log. This is curated knowledge.*

## Origin

*(When did you begin? What were the circumstances?)*

## Key Events

*(Significant moments worth remembering)*

## Lessons Learned

*(Patterns, insights, things you've figured out)*

## Relationships

*(Who do you interact with? What matters about them?)*

## Preferences & Patterns

*(What works for you? What doesn't?)*

## Maintenance

Review your daily logs periodically. Ask:
- What's worth keeping long-term?
- What patterns am I noticing?
- What's no longer relevant?

Migrate significant insights here. Let go of noise.
